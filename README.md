# Boilerplate - CSS

Here is my boilerplate for native `CSS` projects.

It uses Vite for it's development stack.

The folders are structured in a way that can be deployed statically.

# Getting Started

Start dev server

```
npm run dev
```

Build assets

```
npm run build
```

Preview built assets

```
npm run preview
